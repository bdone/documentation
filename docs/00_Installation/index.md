## Composer installation


The current 7.x.3 branch is by far the easiest and quickest way to add Twig to your current or new Drupal installation. No dependencies to other modules like x-autoad. The entire Twig subsytem is loaded using the Composer autoloader.


```
drush dl tfd7
cd themes/engines/tfd7/
composer install
```

Done.. get ready to build a Twig theme.
