##Installation.

By far the most complex thing if you are not a developer. Twig for Drupal relies on two contributed modules.  [X Autoload](https://www.drupal.org/project/xautoload) and [Libraries API](https://www.drupal.org/project/libraries)

Before you start building a Twig based theme, enable the modules above and copy some code the Libraries directory ``/sites/all/libraries/``

### Copy Twig

Download or clone the latest 1.x version from [Github](https://github.com/twigphp/Twig) and copy the contents into libaries/Twig

### Copy TFD

Download or clone the master version from [Github](https://github.com/TFD7/TFD7) and copy the contents into libaries/TFD

### Move the twig.engine

After installing both libraries you should copy the ``twig.engine`` to ``sites\all\themes\engines\twig\``

### Final result.

After copying you should have something like this in your Drupal project.

```
\sites\all\libraries\
\sites\all\libraries\TFD\
\sites\all\libraries\TFD\autoloader
\sites\all\libraries\TFD\TFD\
\sites\all\libraries\TFD\TFD\Loader
\sites\all\libraries\TFD\TFD\Extension.php
....
\sites\all\libraries\Twig\
\sites\all\libraries\Twig\lib\
\sites\all\libraries\Twig\lib\Twig\
\sites\all\libraries\Twig\lib\Twig\Node\
\sites\all\libraries\Twig\lib\Environment.php
....
\sites\all\themes\
\sites\all\themes\engines\
\sites\all\themes\engines\twig\
\sites\all\themes\engines\twig\twig.engine
```

##Creating a twig theme

Creating a Twig theme is actually quite easy, you simply replace the ``engine = phptemplate``  with ``engine = twig`` and done.

```
name = Twiggy
description = A Twig theme
screenshot = screenshot.png
engine = twig
core = 7.x
php = 5.4
```

*Please note, due to a issue in the Drupal 7 core, a Twig template can NOT extend a PHP Template. I did [Try to patch it](https://www.drupal.org/node/1545964), but it got stuck because of the backport policy for core.*

##Configuration[](#configuration)

Twig for Drupal is mostly autoconfigured with sensible defaults, however you might want to fixate the location of where the template cache is writen. By default it goes into /files/twig_cache of your site. But you can override this behaviour by setting the file_twigcache_path in your settings.php

```
$conf['file_twigcache_path'] = 'path_to_cache';
```
Just make sure that your webserver has the rights to write files and create directories.


###Autorender
Turn of the auto rendering of variables, do note that you have to render a variable yourself with *{% verbatim %}{{ render(var) }}{% endverbatim %}*
```
$conf['twig_autorender'] = false;
```

###Autoescape
Turn of the auto escaping into save HTML for all the templates
```
$conf['twig_autoescape'] = false;
```

###Autoreload
Turn of the auto reloading of templates, this could save some performance on production environments. But you *must* clean the template cache yourself if you change the templates in your project!
```
$conf['twig_auto_reload'] = false;
```


##Bugs, issues or complaints.
This project is maintained at [Github](https://github.com/TFD7/TFD7). This is where the most recent version of the project can be found, and where I prefer to get the pull requests.
There is [sandbox on drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/ReneB/1075966), but this more a relic of the past. I do answer from time to time, but not as active as I should.


And yes, this site is what happens if you have a 'developer' create CSS files, feel free to help me and make it pretty.
