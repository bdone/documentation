## Composer installation

Installation.
Please use the 7.x.3 branch instead of the 7.x.2 version. The engine and TFD libraries are the same but the installation process is way simpler!

### Three easy steps, no copy/move needed
```
drush dl tfd7-7.x-3.0-beta1
cd themes/engines/tfd7/
composer install
```
